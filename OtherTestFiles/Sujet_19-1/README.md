# Sujet_19 Project Overview

The `Sujet_19` directory contains the implementation of a simulation project utilizing SimGrid's S4U API. This project is designed to simulate computational tasks while tracking CO2 emissions.

## Project Structure

- **s4u-emission-exec1/**: This directory contains the main simulation implementation.
  - **src/**: Contains the source code files for the simulation.
    - **s4u-emission-exec1.cpp**: The main implementation file that defines the simulation logic and execution.
  - **CMakeLists.txt**: The CMake configuration file for building the project.
  - **README.md**: Documentation specific to the `s4u-emission-exec1` project.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of SimGrid's S4U API in simulating distributed applications and measuring their environmental impact through CO2 emissions.

## Building and Running

To build and run the simulation, navigate to the `s4u-emission-exec1` directory and follow the instructions in its README.md file. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, including the SimGrid library.

## Dependencies

- SimGrid library: Make sure to have the appropriate version of SimGrid installed and configured in your environment.

For more detailed instructions on building and running the simulation, please refer to the `s4u-emission-exec1/README.md` file.
